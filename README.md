online application that can be accessed throughout the organization

for college to manage the student information with regards to
placement details .This project contains all the details of the
students that can be viewed by all the users (read only), but can be
modified only by the student with an authorized service. The
students can update their own information only. Students can search
for the material required for the selection process for placement
papers. Events happening in the college and the achievements of the
student’s i.e. selected students’ details can be viewed by all the
users. So, our project provides a facility of maintaining the details of
the students, and gets the requested list of candidates for the
companies who would like to recruit the people based on a given
